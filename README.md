Let us visualize maps using Tableau.

1) For the Wyandotte example, we'll see the rivers and lakes around Wyandotte County in Kansas, for that we are going to download the following public data:  
  1a) https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/partnership.html  
  Then we'll open it in Tableau connecting to Spatial File. With that done the next step is simply to put the latitude and 
    longitude respectively in the Rows and Columns and the Geometry measure in the Detail (from Marks).

2) For the Cear치 Brazil example, we'll extract the data from two sources, the source 2a is from wikipedia, where we'll get the population from the cities in Cear치, Brazil. And the second source 2b is from the national tourism government website, where we'll find the tourism classication per city in Cear치. The classifications go from A to E, where A are the most well prepared cities to receive tourists.  
  2a) https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lista_de_munic%C3%ADpios_do_Cear%C3%A1_por_popula%C3%A7%C3%A3o  
  2b) http://www.turismo.gov.br/assuntos/8142-mapa-do-turismo-do-cear%C3%A1-cresce-e-estado-chega-a-74-munic%C3%ADpios-com-potencial-tur%C3%ADstico.html  
  I have copied these data above into the excel file: Cear치.xlsx  
  The data needs to be slightly cleaned beforehand and for that we'll use Tableau Prep. With Tableau Prep we'll clean the population variable because it comes from the website originally with spaces as a thousand separator and Tableau would first interpret that as a string instead of a number. And the we'll join both datasets using the city names.
