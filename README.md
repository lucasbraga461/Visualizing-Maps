Let us visualize maps using Tableau.

1) For the Wyandotte example, we'll see the rivers and lakes around Wyandotte County in Kansas, for that we are going to download the following public data:
  1a) https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/partnership.html

Then we'll open it in Tableau connecting to Spatial File. With that done the next step is simply to put the latitude and 
  longitude respectively in the Rows and Columns and the Geometry measure in the Detail (from Marks).

2) For the Ceará Brazil example, we'll extract the data from two sources, the source 2a is from wikipedia, where we'll get the population from the cities in Ceará, Brazil. And the second source 2b is from the national tourism government website, where we'll find the tourism classication per city in Ceará. The classifications go from A to E, where A are the most well prepared cities to receive tourists.
